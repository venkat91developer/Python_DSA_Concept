# Dynamic Programming (DP)

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. 

### It involves two main principles:

#### Optimal Substructure: 
A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

#### Overlapping Subproblems: 
The problem has overlapping subproblems if the solution to the problem can be stored and reused multiple times.

### DP solutions are generally built in two ways:

#### Top-Down (Memoization): 
Start with the original problem, break it down, and store the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

#### Bottom-Up (Tabulation): 
Solve all possible subproblems first, storing each result in a table or array, and use these to solve the larger problem.

Common applications of DP include problems involving optimization, like **finding the longest subsequence, shortest path, or maximum sum in a sequence.** DP is widely used in combinatorial problems and optimization tasks.
